## What is the justification for this Project?

The bureau of geology has multiple siloed "data systems" that are not integrated. This leads to inefficiencies in data management, analysis, and sharing. 

Since there is only one data services team, it makes sense to have a single, unified data system that can serve the needs of all the different teams within the bureau. This will allow for better collaboration, data sharing, and overall efficiency in managing geological data.

The goal of this project is to create a unified data system that allows for better data integration, accessibility, and usability across the bureau.
